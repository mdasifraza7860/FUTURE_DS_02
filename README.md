📊 Key Business Insights
The Churn Baseline: Our overall churn rate is 26.54%, meaning 1 in 4 customers leaves the service.

The "Danger Zone": New customers are the highest risk; 47% of users churn within their first 12 months.

Contract Power: Customers on Month-to-month plans are significantly more likely to leave than those on long-term plans.

Loyalty Reward: Once a customer stays past 2 years, the probability of them leaving drops below 20%.

Value of Tenure: High-tenure customers provide a much higher Lifetime Value (CLV), averaging over $2,000 in total revenue.

Service Impact: Lack of "Tech Support" or "Online Security" is a major predictor of customer departure.

Final Conclusion & Business Summary
Project Goal: The objective was to analyze customer behavior to identify why users leave (churn) and how to keep them longer.

Key Finding 1: The Month-to-Month contract is the biggest driver of churn. Customers on these plans are over 3 times more likely to leave than those on long-term contracts.

Key Finding 2: The first 12 months are the most critical. If a customer stays past the one-year mark, their probability of staying for 5+ years increases significantly.

Key Finding 3: High Monthly Charges combined with a lack of Tech Support services leads to faster churn.

Final Recommendation: To improve retention, the company should offer "Year 1" loyalty discounts and move at-risk month-to-month customers onto annual plans.

Outcome: By implementing these strategies, the company can protect its Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and ensure long-term revenue stability.
