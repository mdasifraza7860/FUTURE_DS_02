Main Findings from the Data
Churn Baseline: I found that about 26.5% of our customers end up leaving. This means roughly 1 out of every 4 people stops using the service.

The First Year: The first 12 months are the most difficult. Almost half (47%) of the customers who leave do so within their first year.

Contract Types: There is a big difference between contracts. People who pay month-to-month leave much more often than those who sign up for a year or two.

Long-term Loyalty: If we can keep a customer for more than 2 years, they usually stay for a long time, and the chance of them leaving drops significantly (below 20%).

Customer Value: Customers who stay longer are much more profitable, bringing in over $2,000 on average throughout their time with us.

Support Services: People who don't have Tech Support or Online Security features tend to quit much faster than those who do.

What I discovered:

Contract issues: The biggest reason people leave is the month-to-month plan. These customers quit 3 times more often than those on long-term contracts.

The 1-year mark: The first year is the most important. If a customer stays past their first anniversary, they are much more likely to stay for many years.

High costs: Customers leave faster when their monthly bills are high, especially if they don't have tech support to help them.

My Recommendations:

We should give discounts to customers during their first year to keep them happy.

We should try to get month-to-month users to switch to yearly plans by offering them a better deal.

This will help the company keep more customers and make more revenue in the long run.
